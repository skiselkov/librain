/*
 * Grand Theory Description:
 *
 * librain uses custom rendering inside of X-Plane's OpenGL engine to draw
 * rain using a complicated multi-stage set of shaders. You need to pass
 * some configuration structures to librain and drive it via some plugin
 * callbacks.
 *
 * The primary configuration mechanism for the rain-on-glass and ice-on-glass
 * portion of librain is via the librain_glass_t structure. To control
 * airframe icing simulation, see surf_ice.h.
 *
 * At plugin load time, you will want to call librain_init() to initialize
 * the library. This call takes three arguments:
 * - a path to the directory containing librain's compiled shader programs
 *   (you need to ship this with your plugin)
 * - an array of librain_glass_t structures describing the individual
 *   glass surfaces you want to simulate individually
 * - the number of items in the above array
 *
 * See below for a description of each field in the librain_glass_t
 * structure. To avoid leaking memory, you MUST call librain_fini() when
 * your plugin is being unloaded.
 *
 * To get librain to draw the glass surface, you must register a custom
 * post-draw callback in the xplm_Phase_LastScene phase, like this:
 *	XPLMRegisterDrawCallback(draw_effects, xplm_Phase_LastScene, 0, NULL);
 *
 * Inside the draw_effects() function, you will need to call the following
 * 4 functions:
 *
 * - librain_draw_prepare()
 * - librain_draw_z_depth() as many times as necessary to populate the Z-buffer
 * - librain_draw_exec()
 * - librain_draw_finish()
 *
 * Here's a rough description of what each of these functions does:
 *
 * 1) librain_draw_prepare()
 *	librain applies screen-space warping to simulate light refraction
 *	through individual water masses. To do so, it must first capture
 *	a "snapshot" of the scene rendered thus far. That's why all of
 *	librain's processing takes place after the "last scene" draw call,
 *	as no more 3D drawing can occur afterwards.
 * 2) librain_draw_z_depth()
 *	To obtain close-in rendering of the water effects using the X-Plane
 *	projection matrix, librain does some tricks by modifying the near-
 *	field clipping plane in the projection matrix. This unfortunately
 *	also trashes the existing Z-buffer of X-Plane. So librain uses its
 *	own Z-buffer, but in order to obtain proper depth-masking of the
 *	rendered rain effects by the aircraft interior & exterior geometry,
 *	we need redo the depth pass of many of the aircraft OBJs.
 *	librain_draw_z_depth() takes an OBJ argument and does a quick
 *	render pass to populate its depth buffer. See librain_draw_z_depth
 *	for more information.
 * 3) librain_draw_exec()
 *	This is the actual rain effect output stage. librain will already
 *	have run its internal passes earlier to move water droplets around.
 *	Here, the renderer just outputs the final 3D stages onto the
 *	screen.
 * 4) librain_draw_finish()
 *	Cleanup call that restores X-Plane's drawing state and releases
 *	any temporary resources that will not be required anymore.
 */

/*
 * This structure configures a single glass "surface" for librain and tells
 * it how to move water around on it in response to various factors. It
 * also informs librain how to finally project the surface onto an aircraft
 * OBJ.

 * Everything physics-related that librain does happens in a virtual square
 * area:

 *
 * In this space, librain generates water droplets when it detects
 * precipitation on the aircraft (by monitoring the
 * sim/weather/precipitation_on_aircraft_ratio dataref). It also moves
 * them around in response to three points, that you define in the
 * librain_glass_t data structure:
 *
 * - gravity_point: defines the position from which gravity "pushes"
 *	(yes, in librain gravity pushes away from a single point, instead
 *	of pulling toward it).
 * - thrust_point: defines from which point engine thrust pushes the
 *	water droplets. On multi-engine aircraft you can easily disable
 *	this, as their engines do not blow engine thrust onto the glass.
 * - wind_point: relative wind origin point. This source of force onto
 *	the water droplets represents the relative wind to the aircraft,
 *	i.e. motion of the aircraft through the air.
 *
 * Please note that the position of these points is ONLY used to
 * determine the force vector direction and NOT its strength. The force
 * imparted by each of these effects is equally strong over the entire
 * glass surface. You can set the position of these points to be away
 * from the glass 0-1 range of the coordinates as well, to simulate
 * a more uniform direction, instead of a radial force:
